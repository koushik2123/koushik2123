Greeting new students at LPU College.

We are suppose to create a welcome page for new students when they login on our site.

We want to isolate main component from greeting text so we choose to create a welcome component that takes name as input and output a welcome message.


Create a Welcome component(greeting message) in Welcome.js

Use React functional component to do so.

Output the welcome message "Hey !" where name is name of the student using h1 tag.

Also render the "Welcome to College." using h2 tag.

A prop named "name" will be passed to Welcome component use it in writing greeting text.



Acceptance criteria

Welcome message should be as given in the Details section.
